The predictor also manages a prediction cache associated with input matrices. If possible, it will use previously calculated predictions instead of calculating new predictions. Prediction functions all take a GBTreeModel and a DMatrix as input and output a vector of predictions. The predictor does not modify any state of the model itself. " alt="" coords="5,13,133,39"/>
